# Idea 1

## The need, the user, and you
**This section describes whom the project would serve and why you're interested
in the project.**
The project would help student to easily manipulate the data and visualize it. 


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? How would their experience improve if you could help 
them?_
math modeling purpose. the math modelers. as for me, I need to learn matlab and some modules in python in order to visualize the data. And during
the sensitivity test or other situation where I need to do a lot of calculation, I need to do many unnecessary process to reach my goal. With this
DSL, we can save many time on this tech problems and help get better result.


### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
I am the president of school's math modeling club. I want to help all the students in my club to success.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
math modeling


## The language
**This section helps you argue that a DSL can serve the need(s) described in
the previous section.**
data manipulation; visualize charts or 3D graphs.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
this is complicated works for people to do but it will be much simpler with the help of computer. 

### Linguistic pieces
**For each question below, brainstorm a few answers. If a question does not
apply to your project, explain why.**

_What are some likely nouns in this domain? (Nouns correspond to kinds of
data. In our image manipulation DSL, an **image** is a noun.)_
mean_value
matrix


_What are some likely adjectives? (Adjectives correspond to values for a
particular kind of data; for example: a **JPEG** image.)_ 
matrix(2x2)
list()


_What are some likely verbs? (Verbs correspond to behaviors or actions; for
example: **rotating**.)_
integrate
derivative
sort
linear_regression
confidence_interval


_What are some likely adverbs? (Verbs correspond to modifications to a specific
behavior or action; for example: rotating **left**.)_



### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_
it shoule be easy to read and understand the code.
importing the excel file may be difficult


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? What do you like about the language? Are there parts
of the language you think could be improved?_
Mathematica: but this is much complicated and for various purpose. Mines only focused on math modeling part.


## The Project
**This section examines whether the idea makes for a good project for this
course.**
in my opinion, this idea is workable. it does take time but it will be very useful once finished.

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language-design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated visualization that doesn't require a
lot of language design)?_
my goal would be 2:8.
I am not sure what "system" aspects means


### Scope
_How ambitious is this project for you? Not very? Somewhat? Very?_
I am very interested in this project.


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project?_ 
It has place to use; it is technically workable

_Why might this not be a good idea project?_
some difficulties during the process; needed to import other module.
