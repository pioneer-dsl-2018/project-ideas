# Idea 1

## The need, the user, and you
Idea 1: creating a DSL for people who wanted to learn programming and create a simple application to use programming. (i.e. Karel.)


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? How would their experience improve if you could help 
them?_
I am trying to help programming novices as I had some problems when I first learned programming. 
If I could make learning programming easier, it would benefit the whole programming community.


### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
This excited me as I have tried to help my sister learn coding in the past, but due to the sheer amount of information,
she wasn't able to learn it with ease. Now, with the information from DSL, I could improve upon and also make learning to code more interactive. 

### Domain
Java in graphic console


## The language
**This section helps you argue that a DSL can serve the need(s) described in
the previous section.**
For me, Java is the 1st language I am exposed to and also the language I am mist familiar with.
As Java is object oriented, once the concept is understood, it's simple to figure out the rest. 

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
When one begins coding, a lot of people are stuck with the syntax problems. 
If the syntax are made to be easier or non-existant, it will be much easier for people to learn coding. 
With DSL, once we got rid of the host flavor, it's not hard to make the program more flexible. 

### Linguistic pieces
**For each question below, brainstorm a few answers. If a question does not
apply to your project, explain why.**

_What are some likely nouns in this domain? (Nouns correspond to kinds of
data. In our image manipulation DSL, an **image** is a noun.)_
Item
map
ball




_What are some likely adjectives? (Adjectives correspond to values for a
particular kind of data; for example: a **JPEG** image.)_ 

Color (red, yellow.....)
blocked
open

_What are some likely verbs? (Verbs correspond to behaviors or actions; for
example: **rotating**.)_

move
turn
pick
drop


_What are some likely adverbs? (Verbs correspond to modifications to a specific
behavior or action; for example: rotating **left**.)_

right
left
around

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_
It should be easy to make and manipulate the character aroun the map. What is going to be impossible to to exceed the map, or maze and creating something past that. 

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? What do you like about the language? Are there parts
of the language you think could be improved?_


## The Project
**This section examines whether the idea makes for a good project for this
course.**

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language-design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated visualization that doesn't require a
lot of language design)?_
If one were to work on this project, the language would take around 30-40 persent of the time. 


### Scope
_How ambitious is this project for you? Not very? Somewhat? Very?_
I believe that the project would be somewhat ambitious as it touched upon many unfamiliar aspect of coding. 

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project?_ 
This is one of the languages that I could strife to make the project to the best of my ability. 

_Why might this not be a good idea project?_
Using java may not be the best choice as it is not very flexible.
