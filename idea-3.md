# Idea 3

## The need, the user, and you
**This section describes whom the project would serve and why you're interested
in the project.**
people want to draw the 3d functions using spherical, cylidrencal or cartician system.
I am interested because I just took the test in which I spend 80% of my time drawing it.

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? How would their experience improve if you could help 
them?_
help understanding the 3d system as well as the multivariable calculus
I found hard to picture(imagine) the graph in 3d
with the help of this, I could continue playing with all functions and getting sense about the 3d system

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
As mentioned eariler, I almost fail the test because of the drawing part.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
plot functions in 3-d surfaces

## The language
**This section helps you argue that a DSL can serve the need(s) described in
the previous section.**
we would just need to plug in the fuction and get the results without thinking anything

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
because it is hard for us to transform among spherical, cylidrencal or cartician system.
Computer can automatically calculated for us

### Linguistic pieces
**For each question below, brainstorm a few answers. If a question does not
apply to your project, explain why.**

_What are some likely nouns in this domain? (Nouns correspond to kinds of
data. In our image manipulation DSL, an **image** is a noun.)_
x
y
z
(rou)
(theta)
(fi)

_What are some likely adjectives? (Adjectives correspond to values for a
particular kind of data; for example: a **JPEG** image.)_ 
bounded

_What are some likely verbs? (Verbs correspond to behaviors or actions; for
example: **rotating**.)_
rotating
flipping
moving

_What are some likely adverbs? (Verbs correspond to modifications to a specific
behavior or action; for example: rotating **left**.)_
up
down
left
right

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_
easy: create the function and plot it into 3d
hard: calculation of the volume; transformation between three systems
very difficult: /

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? What do you like about the language? Are there parts
of the language you think could be improved?_
not really. I looked up and only found the 3d grapher for cartician system only. And there is not any grapher that allows the spherical or cylindrical

## The Project
**This section examines whether the idea makes for a good project for this
course.**
it is comparatively easy but needed a lot of mutivariable calculus thinking.

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language-design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated visualization that doesn't require a
lot of language design)?_
9:1
*still, not sure what this question means*

### Scope
_How ambitious is this project for you? Not very? Somewhat? Very?_
somewhat little below idea-2

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project?_ 
it is easier to implement compared to previous two

_Why might this not be a good idea project?_
the usage of this language is very limited; I might need to come up with other useful functions for this project.
