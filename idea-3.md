# Idea 1

## The need, the user, and you
**This section describes whom the project would serve and why you're interested
in the project.**


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? How would their experience improve if you could help 
them?_ In my school, checking items like computers and ipads out of the computer lab had always been a hassle. 
Currently, our system does not have a very clear reserve and check in/out program available. I believe that if I can create somethig that can suit the needs of the school, it will be of great help to the community. 


### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
It excited me that I am able to give back to the community and also solve real-world problem that extends outside of just myself. I came up with it after recalling my conversation with my robotics teacher who also happened to be the technology manager. He told me that the system our school is using is not great.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
Check-in/out of items

## The language
**This section helps you argue that a DSL can serve the need(s) described in
the previous section.**

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
I believe that a DSL is needed as this is something with a very narrow scope. Also, this project required many specific things that apply to only my specific school, making a DSL a good and sensible choice. 

### Linguistic pieces
**For each question below, brainstorm a few answers. If a question does not
apply to your project, explain why.**

_What are some likely nouns in this domain? (Nouns correspond to kinds of
data. In our image manipulation DSL, an **image** is a noun.)_
Laptop
Ipads
Time
Block
Amount
teacher name
_What are some likely adjectives? (Adjectives correspond to values for a
particular kind of data; for example: a **JPEG** image.)_ 

number 1
color(red, blue....)
size

_What are some likely verbs? (Verbs correspond to behaviors or actions; for
example: **rotating**.)_

Check 
returned
out


_What are some likely adverbs? (Verbs correspond to modifications to a specific
behavior or action; for example: rotating **left**.)_
out
in
at .... time



### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy for teachers to check out electronics for a specific amount of time and sign them back in at times. 
What is going to be hard is going to be making sure that they are returned, so keeping track of the records is going to be essential. 

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? What do you like about the language? Are there parts
of the language you think could be improved?_


## The Project
**This section examines whether the idea makes for a good project for this
course.**

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language-design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated visualization that doesn't require a
lot of language design)?_

If this is going to be worked on, I think that 60
5 of the time is going to be language related as there are many specific things to code and apply to the program to make it narrow. 
### Scope
_How ambitious is this project for you? Not very? Somewhat? Very?_

This should be a somewhat ambitious project for me. 

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project?_ 
This is a good idea as this connects to my real life experiences. Also, this is something I could do to change my environment. 

_Why might this not be a good idea project?_
This could be harder to complete as maybe some aspects of the project may not be as easy as it seems. 

### Examples
Check out 2 ipads at A block.

Signing out 3 laptops for D block.

Check out laptop#1, laptop #2, laptop #3 for the whole day.

Returned ipads.
