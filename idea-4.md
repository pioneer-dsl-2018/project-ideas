# Idea 4

## The need, the user, and you
**This section describes whom the project would serve and why you're interested
in the project.**


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? How would their experience improve if you could help 
them?_

The domain this language would attempt to cater to is finance: primarily financial and business analysis for small business owners. This project will essentially be a domain-specific language that functions as a finance manager and ratio calculator. There exist a number of different ratios which can be derived through the analysis of a business’s income statement and balance sheet. However, the existence and calculation of these ratios, as well as the managing of these documents can be particularly difficult for new business owners. This DSL will enable small business owners to manage their finance’s by inputting their company’s financial information (e.g. different costs, revenue, profits, liabilities, etc.) and by then allowing them to evaluate different business decisions by calculating area-specific ratios and tax liabilities for them. For instance, when trying to decide whether or not to take out a bank loan, a business owner could run a method which calculates their debt-to-equity ratio, interest coverage ratio, etc. and basis those and past financial information, outputs whether or not it is statistically recommendable to do so. Currently, several new businesses may fail due to poor financial management in the first few months. Such a DSL which provides an entrepreneur with all the information and statistics they need to make a particular business decision by analyzing their finances as well as calculating the probability of such a business decision being successful basis those ratios could greatly help them.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I find this project extremely interesting due to my keen fascination with the stock market and their extensive utilisation of ratios in making important decisions. In addition to this, the potential uses of this to various stakeholders, including banks, investors, etc. as well as the possible extensibility of the project make it exciting for me to work on. I came up with this idea once while researching a variety of stock ratios for a competition I partook in.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Finance, Small Businesses, Mathematics, Financial Ratios

## The language
**This section helps you argue that a DSL can serve the need(s) described in
the previous section.**

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

This, to my understanding, would be a DSL for simulation in that it would enable users to save on time and effort. In addition to this, I believe that a DSL can be particularly useful due to the ease of use and linguistic customizing ability in that it can be used to create methods to calculate specific ratios as well as sort them by potential uses. Another reason I think a DSL would appropriately address the need is because it could make it hassle-free and faster for a business owner to not only calculate these ratios but also use them the right way.

### Linguistic pieces
**For each question below, brainstorm a few answers. If a question does not
apply to your project, explain why.**

_What are some likely nouns in this domain? (Nouns correspond to kinds of
data. In our image manipulation DSL, an **image** is a noun.)_

Gross Profit, Net Profit, Tax Liability, Total Liability, Owners’ Equity, Total Revenue

_What are some likely adjectives? (Adjectives correspond to values for a
particular kind of data; for example: a **JPEG** image.)_ 

The data types are most likely to be primarily numbers since most of the nouns are numerical parameters.

_What are some likely verbs? (Verbs correspond to behaviors or actions; for
example: **rotating**.)_

The verbs in this case could consist of:

1)    The uses of the ratios: E.g. Loan probability (whether or not a loan should be taken out basis the finances), productivity (evaluating the business’s labour productivity, raw-material productivity – comparing it to past months)
2)    The ratios themselves (Earnings per share, return on investment, gross profitability)

_What are some likely adverbs? (Verbs correspond to modifications to a specific
behavior or action; for example: rotating **left**.)_

I am not entirely certain adverbs would be applicable to this language since most verbs ask for the calculation of particular values.

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

It should be easy for new business owners to evaluate the different aspects of their business using this language and its compiled probabilities and ratios. Since this language must be extremely specific to finances for a business, hence using any other methods must not be possible using it.

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? What do you like about the language? Are there parts
of the language you think could be improved?_

I was unable to find any DSLs specifically intended for this purpose in this domain when conducting research on the internet for the same. I think the reason why this might be is because most businesses rely on financial experts to conduct such analyses. However, for a small, new business, this might not be an affordable option in which case a DSL might be extremely useful.

## The Project
**This section examines whether the idea makes for a good project for this
course.**

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language-design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated visualization that doesn't require a
lot of language design)?_

I believe that in working on this project, about 50% of the language implementer’s time would be dedicated to language design and the other 50% would be dedicated to the systems aspect of the project, i.e. comprehending and categorizing financial ratios and information.


### Scope
_How ambitious is this project for you? Not very? Somewhat? Very?_

I believe this project is somewhat ambitious for me but may in fact be constraining in terms of language design as compared to the other projects.


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project?_ 

I believe this might be a good idea for a project since it is something I find interesting and would enjoy working on. Moreover, there exists a need for such a language and its users could greatly benefit from such a DSL.


_Why might this not be a good idea project?_

This may not be a good idea for a project since I believe the level of customization and language design might be limited as compared to the other potential project ideas.
