# Idea 2

## The need, the user, and you
**This section describes whom the project would serve and why you're interested
in the project.**


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? How would their experience improve if you could help 
them?_ Personally, I am a person who does not excel in organizing his time. More often than not, I would decide to do something
then forgets it soon after. At times like this, it would be very helpful to have a calender around. And as one who 
do not like keeping a physical calender around, making a calender that is simple to use is an important task.


### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
What excites me is that there could be a good solution to my problem of keeping track of my time. 
I got the idea from the prompts and combined with some ideas and my faults, I wanted to make this calender. 


### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
Calender for time and tasks

## The language
**This section helps you argue that a DSL can serve the need(s) described in
the previous section.**

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
A DSL is necessary as for many users, using a calender may not be the same for everyone. 
More often than not, people needed to adapt to programs that are harder to use. Combined
with some regional differences, this adds to the complexity of the problem. 

### Linguistic pieces
**For each question below, brainstorm a few answers. If a question does not
apply to your project, explain why.**

_What are some likely nouns in this domain? (Nouns correspond to kinds of
data. In our image manipulation DSL, an **image** is a noun.)_
Monday, Tuesday.....
Januray, february....
Task, 
Date, 
Time

_What are some likely adjectives? (Adjectives correspond to values for a
particular kind of data; for example: a **JPEG** image.)_ 


_What are some likely verbs? (Verbs correspond to behaviors or actions; for
example: **rotating**.)_
Completed, 
Ongoing
Recording
Saved

_What are some likely adverbs? (Verbs correspond to modifications to a specific
behavior or action; for example: rotating **left**.)_
Revised
Changed
Deleted
Added

### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

Something that should be easy to do in this language could be to assign a task to a certain time frame and maybe repeat it. 
Soething hard or difficult could be getting the person to actually do the task, or maybe to fit into all the regional differences in the world

### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? What do you like about the language? Are there parts
of the language you think could be improved?_

There are things like FSCalender, JTApple Calender, Material CalenderView, Full Calender, and React big calender. 

One thing that I think could be improved is maybe notifying the user about the event, or maybe classifying the events by color to increase the distinction. 

## The Project
**This section examines whether the idea makes for a good project for this
course.**

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language-design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated visualization that doesn't require a
lot of language design)?_

I believe that around 40-50 persent of the time will be the language as there are certainly a lot of spaces for improvement of the calenders. 

### Scope
_How ambitious is this project for you? Not very? Somewhat? Very?_
This project should be somewhat ambitious as I am touching on something I have never experienced before. 

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project?_ 
This project is straightforward, it is beneficial, useful, and not overly time consuming

_Why might this not be a good idea project?_
This idea could be very broad or generic, and maybe the modifications will not be useful at all.
