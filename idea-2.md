# Idea 2

## The need, the user, and you
**This section describes whom the project would serve and why you're interested
in the project.**
people interested in deep learning but does not really know algorithom. I learn a little bit deep learning earlier this year and interested to
move into a new stage through this project.

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? How would their experience improve if you could help 
them?_
people want to try what deep learning look like but does not want to spend much time on specific algorithm. It is hard to learn all the concepts
behind and the implementation of logistic regression; activation functions; L-layer neural networks and etc.

### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_
I think this project can help me learn more about deep learning and its algorithm.

### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._
deep learning

## The language
**This section helps you argue that a DSL can serve the need(s) described in
the previous section.**
easily set up the neutral network function; logistic regression; manipulated the matrix and higer order Neural network.


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_
it can help people understand the basic idea of deep learning without knowing all the complex concepts

### Linguistic pieces
**For each question below, brainstorm a few answers. If a question does not
apply to your project, explain why.**

_What are some likely nouns in this domain? (Nouns correspond to kinds of
data. In our image manipulation DSL, an **image** is a noun.)_
matrix
parameters
hyperparameters


_What are some likely adjectives? (Adjectives correspond to values for a
particular kind of data; for example: a **JPEG** image.)_ 
layer
vector

_What are some likely verbs? (Verbs correspond to behaviors or actions; for
example: **rotating**.)_
propagation
logistic_regression
activation_function

_What are some likely adverbs? (Verbs correspond to modifications to a specific
behavior or action; for example: rotating **left**.)_
forward
backward
first(derivative)
second(derivative)


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_
easy: set up the matrix and shorten the expression
hard: all the concepts(I have not fully gotten all of them yet.)
very difficult: (...)


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? What do you like about the language? Are there parts
of the language you think could be improved?_
Yes. OptiML. I feel like some expressions do not really remove the host_flavor.


## The Project
**This section examines whether the idea makes for a good project for this
course.**
It connects what we learnt from the course with the latest(hottest) topic in the world, in which I can have a deeper understanding through this project.


### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language-design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated visualization that doesn't require a
lot of language design)?_
my goal would be 3:7

### Scope
_How ambitious is this project for you? Not very? Somewhat? Very?_
Very, but little less than idea-1


### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project?_ 
it makes me exciting and the topic is really interesting

_Why might this not be a good idea project?_
some concepts may be little hard for me to understand
it is little challenge
